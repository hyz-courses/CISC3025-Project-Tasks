CISC3025 Natural Language Processing Project Tasks.

## Project Task 1: Implementation and Usage of a Sequence Comparison Algorithm using Levenshtein Distance

### Introduction:  
&emsp; This project implements a sequence comparison algorithm based on the
Levenshtein distance using Python and gives an example of its usage. It also extends this to
sentence comparison by extensively tokenizing the sentences.

### Key Words: 
Levenshtein Distance, Sequence Comparison, String Similarity

### Algorithms:
1. Dynamic Programming;
2. Array Restoration: Single-sided tree.
